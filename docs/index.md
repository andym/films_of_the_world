* [Tangerines](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2991224/) (2013)

### Post-Film Q and A

* What about the film caught your imagination?

The trader is the archetypal "white van man", in a role that's existed forever. He's like a medieval trader on the silk road with his van full of wonders.

"Potatoes and Tangerines and shashlik."

It was a little bit "last of the summer wine" when the guys in Tangerines pushed the van off the cliff.

* What do you think the film set out to achieve and was it successful?

The trader set out to be a portrait of the poorer parts of Georgian society and how they trade and are perhaps exploited by the trader. Life seemed very basic and it's a shock to realise that Georgia is still part of europe. It seemed like an accurate portrayal.

_A discussion ensued about the relative value of potatoes and cash between the UK and Georgia_

The aim of Tangerines was much more straightforward - it seemed to be about the futility of war and maybe to tell a little of the history of the Caucasus. We liked that Ivo wasn't moralising. The story was simple - it was a bit like a disney film. We couldn't tell who the film was made for.

* To what kind of person would you recommend this film?

We had a discussion about how mainstream tangerines was. Not a blockbuster, but accessible. We would not recommend it to anyone in particular, there are better films.

"The trader could be recommended to economics students."

* What did you learn about this country?

Beautiful countryside. Some of the history. The complicated ethnic mix in georgia.
Tangerines could almost have been set anywhere though, so we didn't learn that much.

* Did this film make you want to see more films from this country?

Yes. Tangerines was a bit too general, but the trader was interesting. Both were well photographed, both accessible. 
Georgia is recognisably european, but in rural areas very poor, so very different. 

## 09/08/2018 - #12 - Guyana

We watched:-

* [The White Diamond](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435776/) (2004)

![The White Diamond](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNTg5ODY4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUwMDEzMQ@@._V1_UY268_CR3,0,182,268_AL_.jpg)

### Post-Film Q and A

* What about the film caught your imagination?

Floating in an airship above the canopy of a forest.

The film was very meditative with quite dreamy imagery. There was a strong contrast between the manic inventor guy and the slow ponderous airship.
The proximity of hell (a diamond mine) to the heaven of a beautiful forest and wildlife. 

The extended scene at the end with the swallows swooping out of the sky in their thousands to roost behind the mysterious waterfall.

Some people follow a childhood dream of flying. 

* What do you think the film set out to achieve and was it successful?

The idea seemed to be "here's an interesting person, attempting something slightly crazy - what will happen next"?

Despite being sometimes meandering and perhaps inconsequential, it was successful in conveying the story. They also took advantage of the amazing scenery and caught some incredible wildlife on film.

Part of the reason for building the airship was that it was supposed to be able to capture unique footage of the canopy without disturbing the wildlife - we didn't see any of this. Did they fail their own goals?

The film and escapade in the forest was attempting to address the inventors guilt about a previous accident, but this was undercut by presenting him as an adventurer. So maybe not sucessful there.

Was presented as an adventure in the wilderness, but actually not that remote (within a few miles of a mine and a village).

* To what kind of person would you recommend this film?

It's an interesing documentary, so anyone interested in offbeat documentary. A curiosty, but not a life changer.  

"Anyone who enjoys german accents."

* What did you learn about this country?

We didn't know they were english speaking (due to it being an ex-British colony), and didn't know the country is mainly rastafarian. 

The country has breathtakingly beautiful nature.

* Did this film make you want to see more films from this country?

This film was an outsiders view of the country. You got a sense of the culture but it didn't want to make us see more.

#### What happens?
Two Tannese fall in love, and challenge Tanna’s tradition of arranged marriage.

#### Where does it fit in film culture?
Although the film was directed by two Australians who had previously made documentaries, the actors and characters all live on the island of Tanna, and developed the story from an actual event on the island twenty years before.

#### Tone?
Humans behave the same everywhere, even when wearing grass skirts for an initiation rite on an errupting volcano.

* What about the film caught your imagination?

It captured the madness of isolation well. The way in which despotic regimes set up incentives to betray their fellow citizens in support of the regime. 

* What do you think the film set out to achieve and was it successful? 

The film is a post-communist film all about the recent past. Which is portrayed as nihilistic and focussed on the darker impulses of human nature.

To gain a wider audience it could have been a black comedy, it was too bleak to be accessible. 

* To what kind of person would you recommend this film?

A person with an extreme left or right ideology to show the destructive power of the individual. (AM) I don't think it would put them off.

* What did you learn about this country?

This was clearly a difficult period in Bulgarias past.

* Did this film make you want to see more films from this country?

(GO) No. (AM) Yes. Because they can't all be as bleak as that. (A) Yes. I'd like to see what other themes their films address.
