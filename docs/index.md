Although the film was directed by two Australians who had previously made documentaries, the actors and characters all live on the island of Tanna, and developed the story from an actual event on the island twenty years before.

#### Tone?
Humans behave the same everywhere, even when wearing grass skirts for an initiation rite on an errupting volcano.

* What about the film caught your imagination?

It captured the madness of isolation well. The way in which despotic regimes set up incentives to betray their fellow citizens in support of the regime. 

* What do you think the film set out to achieve and was it successful? 

The film is a post-communist film all about the recent past. Which is portrayed as nihilistic and focussed on the darker impulses of human nature.

To gain a wider audience it could have been a black comedy, it was too bleak to be accessible. 

* To what kind of person would you recommend this film?

A person with an extreme left or right ideology to show the destructive power of the individual. (AM) I don't think it would put them off.

* What did you learn about this country?

This was clearly a difficult period in Bulgarias past.

* Did this film make you want to see more films from this country?

(GO) No. (AM) Yes. Because they can't all be as bleak as that. (A) Yes. I'd like to see what other themes their films address.
